            <h3>Pre History</h3>
            <p>The city proper begins around 660 BCE when Greek settlers from Megara founded Byzantium on the European side of the Bosporus. 
                The city thrived, saw Persian and later Roman rule, and officially became part of the Roman Empire in 73 CE. 
                Byzantium was severely damaged after supporting the usurper Pescennius Niger but was rebuilt by Septimius Severus.

            <h3>Byzantine Era</h3>
            <p>
                Constantine the Great rebuilt Byzantium as a Christian city named Nova Roma, later called Constantinople, proclaimed capital of the Roman Empire in 330 CE. 
                It became a center of Greek culture and Christianity, home to landmarks like Hagia Sophia and the Hippodrome. Constantinople was Europe’s largest and wealthiest city during the Middle Ages and the cradle of Orthodox Christian civilization. 
                After Basil II’s reign; in 1204 the Fourth Crusade sacked it, establishing the Latin Empire. 
                The Byzantines recaptured Constantinople in 1261 but weakened military policies and Ottoman encirclement led to its fall on 29 May 1453 to Mehmed II.

            <h3>Ottoman Period</h3>
            <p> Mehmed II declared Constantinople the Ottoman capital, converting Hagia Sophia into a mosque and transforming the city with new mosques, palaces, and markets like the Grand Bazaar. 
                The Ottoman Empire flourished culturally under Suleiman the Magnificent. The 19th century brought political reforms, new technology, and railway connections, but modernization couldn’t prevent the empire’s decline.
                The Young Turk Revolution (1908) marked political shifts; WWI and the Armenian genocide devastated the empire. The city was occupied by Allied forces after the war until the Turkish War of Independence ended Ottoman rule in 1922.

            <h3>Turkish Republic</h3>
            <p>TWith the Republic declared in 1923, Ankara became the capital. Istanbul’s non-Muslim populations, especially Greeks, faced persecution and mass emigration throughout the 20th century. 
                From the 1950s, rapid urbanization transformed the city, expanding it into a vast metropolitan area as migrants arrived seeking work, reshaping Istanbul’s landscape.
